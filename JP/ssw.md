 How to Prepare for the Exam

1. Master the Core Content Areas
Focus your studies on the three official domains, with special attention to Japanese standards:

Hygiene Management & HACCP: This is often cited as critical. Study general food safety, Japanese hygiene protocols, and HACCP principles thoroughly.
Food & Beverage Preparation: Understand common Japanese cooking techniques, ingredients, and kitchen equipment knowledge.
Customer Service in Japan: Learn the unique aspects of Japanese hospitality ("omotenashi"), how to handle complaints, and knowledge about dietary diversity.
2. Study the Japanese Language
Since the test is entirely in Japanese, you need strong reading skills for technical vocabulary. To qualify for the SSW (i) visa, you must also pass a separate Japanese language test:

JLPT (Japanese-Language Proficiency Test): N4 level or higher.
JFT-Basic (Japan Foundation Test): A2 level or higher (score of 200+).
Focus on vocabulary related to food, cooking, hygiene, and customer service.

3. Use Available Resources
Look for official textbooks or training manuals from the test sponsor, OTAFF.
Seek out practice tests or sample questions to familiarize yourself with the CBT format and question styles (judgment and planning questions).
Consider preparatory courses if available, which can help with both sector-specific knowledge and language skills.

🖥️ Step-by-Step Application & Test Day Process


1. Create a Prometric ID
If you don't have one, create a Prometric ID on their website. This is the most critical step:

You must register using the exact name as it appears on your official identification document (e.g., passport).
Names cannot be changed after reservation.
It is prohibited to have multiple Prometric IDs.
2. Schedule Your Exam
Log in with your Prometric ID and schedule your test during the reservation period.

Deadline: You can book or change a reservation until 11:59 PM (Japan Time) three business days before your chosen test date (four days if the test falls on a weekend/Japanese holiday).
Cancellations: Cancellations are NOT possible. Even if there's an error in your booking, you cannot cancel or get a refund after completion.
3. Pay the Test Fee
Test fees and payment methods vary depending on the country where you take the exam. You will find specific payment instructions during the scheduling process on the Prometric website.

4. What to Bring on Test Day
Your Confirmation Letter.
Original, Valid Photo Identification: The name must exactly match your Prometric ID. Copies or digital versions on a phone are not accepted. A passport is typically the best form of ID.
5. Test Day Protocols
Arrive early: Doors open 45 minutes before the exam. You must arrive at least 30 minutes before. If you are late, you will not be allowed to take the test and will not receive a refund.
Dress Code: Note that specific test centers (like Ateneo University in the Philippines) have strict clothing prohibitions against sleeveless shirts, shorts, sportswear, slippers, etc.

After the Exam: Results & Next Steps
Getting Your Results
Immediate Result: Your pass/fail result will be displayed on the computer screen immediately after you complete the test.
Official Notification: You can log into your Prometric account (My Page) to view and print your official result notification within 5 business days after taking the test.
If You Pass: The Path to Japan
Pass the Japanese Language Test: Remember, you must also pass either the JLPT N4 or JFT-Basic A2 to meet the full visa requirements.
Find an Employer: Secure a job offer from a food service company in Japan (e.g., restaurants, hotels, izakaya).
Sign an Employment Contract: Your future employer acts as your "Accepting Organization".
Apply for the Visa: Your employer will help you apply for the "Certificate of Eligibility," after which you can apply for the SSW visa at a Japanese embassy or consulate.
